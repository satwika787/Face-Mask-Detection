# Face Mask Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced Face Mask Detection system using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to accurately identify individuals wearing masks in diverse scenarios.

## Key Features
- Implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Meticulously preprocessed images for standardized dimensions, color format, and scaled pixel values.
- Integrated dense layers with dropout mechanisms for optimal model classification.

## Core Architecture
- Utilized a sophisticated CNN with two convolutional layers and max-pooling for efficient feature extraction.

## Evaluation
Thoroughly assessed training and validation performance:
- Training Loss: 0.2145
- Accuracy: 91.26%
